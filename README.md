# Unofficial Netflix Wrapped With Python

Inspired by Spotify Wrapped, I wrote a notebook that takes your Netflix Viewing History in CSV format as its input and produces fun statistical summaries of your viewing patterns over the year 2021. This notebook utilizes the IMDb film website's API to obtain additional data about shows and the Python Pandas library to analyze the data. <br />

To see how you can obtain your Netflix Viewing History in CSV format, please visit this link: https://help.netflix.com/en/node/101917. You can fork the folder and change the input file to your own CSV file to obtain your very own Netflix Wrapped for 2021! <br /> 

I have written a blog post that explains some of the steps in more detail here: https://www.jagannarayanan.com/posts/making-my-own-netflix-wrapped-for-2021-with-python/
